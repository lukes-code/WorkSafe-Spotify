A react app built in two days (initial release).<br />
Making use of the Spotify REST API.<br />
This API requires authentication through implicit flow (client side) in order to see and display user information, there is no back end for this app this is why I chose to use implicit flow out of the three auth types provided by Spotify.<br />

✔️ Personalised summary of top 25 tracks sorted in to safe and not safe for work<br />
✔️ Search any artist in the Spotify library<br />
✔️ See their top ten tracks sorted by safe and not safe<br />
